      "That is, without a doubt, one of the most profound and enduring questions humanity has ever asked. There is no single, universally accepted answer, and that is the beauty of it. The question itself pushes us to think about our values, our purpose, and our place in the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of one answer, let's explore the most powerful perspectives that have been offered throughout history. They generally fall into a few key categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. The Religious & Spiritual Perspective: Meaning is Given\n",
      "This viewpoint suggests that meaning is given to us by a higher power or cosmic order. Our purpose is to discover and fulfill that predefined role.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Abrahamic Religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism):** The meaning of life is to know, love, and serve God. Life on Earth is a test or a journey, with the ultimate goal being salvation, paradise, or unity with God. The purpose is found in devotion, righteous action, and adherence to divine commandments.\n",
      "*   **Eastern Religions (Hinduism, Buddhism):** The focus is on enlightenment and liberation from suffering.\n",
      "    *   In **Hinduism**, the goal is to achieve *Moksha*—liberation from the cycle of reincarnation (*Samsara*)—by understanding one's true self (*Atman*) and its unity with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*), while fulfilling one's duty (*Dharma*).\n",
      "    *   In **Buddhism**, the meaning is to end suffering by detaching from desire and the self. This is achieved by following the Eightfold Path to reach *Nirvana*, a state of perfect peace and enlightenment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. The Philosophical Perspective: Meaning is Created or Discovered\n",
      "Philosophy offers a diverse set of answers, but many modern schools of thought argue that meaning is not something we receive, but something we must create for ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Existentialism (Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus):** This is perhaps the most famous philosophical take. Existentialists believe that \"existence precedes essence.\" This means you are born without a pre-ordained purpose. You exist first, and then, through your choices and actions, you create your own meaning and essence.\n",
      "    *   **Camus** called the human need for meaning in a meaningless universe \"the Absurd.\" He argued that the meaning of life is to live in rebellion against this absurdity. He famously used the myth of **Sisyphus**—condemned to roll a boulder up a hill for eternity, only for it to roll back down. Camus concludes, \"One must imagine Sisyphus happy,\" because Sisyphus finds meaning and freedom in the struggle itself.\n",
      "*   **Stoicism (Marcus Aurelius, Seneca):** The meaning of life is to live a life of virtue and reason, in accordance with nature. The key is to focus on what you can control (your own thoughts and actions) and accept what you cannot. Meaning is found in inner peace, resilience, and duty.\n",
      "*   **Nihilism (Friedrich Nietzsche):** This is the rejection of all meaning. A nihilist believes life is objectively without purpose, value, or truth. While this sounds bleak, some (like Nietzsche) saw it as liberating. If there are no pre-existing values, we are free to create our own \"superman\" values.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. The Scientific & Biological Perspective: Meaning is Functional\n",
      "From a purely scientific standpoint, the question of \"meaning\" can be seen as a category error. Biology doesn't ask \"why,\" it asks \"how.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Biological \"Purpose\":** The purpose of a living organism is to survive and reproduce. Your genes have been passed down through an unbroken chain of successful ancestors for billions of years. In this view, your biological meaning is to continue that chain. Richard Dawkins' \"The Selfish Gene\" popularizes this idea: we are survival machines for our genes.\n",
      "*   **The Cosmic Perspective:** From the vastness of the cosmos, our individual lives seem infinitesimally small and brief. Astronomer Carl Sagan beautifully articulated this duality: we are insignificant in the grand scale of the universe, but we are also the universe's way of becoming conscious of itself. In this, we can find a profound sense of wonder and connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. The Personal & Humanist Perspective: Meaning is Subjective\n",
      "Perhaps the most practical and popular modern view is that meaning is not one grand, cosmic thing, but a mosaic of many things. It is subjective, personal, and can change throughout your life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this view, the meaning of life is found in:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Connection & Relationships:** Love, family, friendship, community. The bonds we build with others are often cited as the most significant source of meaning.\n",
      "*   **Contribution & Service:** Making a positive impact on the world, helping others, or contributing to a cause larger than yourself. This can be through your work, volunteering, or simply being kind.\n",
      "*   **Growth & Experience:** The process of learning, overcoming challenges, and experiencing the full spectrum of human emotion—joy, sorrow, wonder, and awe.\n",
      "*   **Creativity & Self-Expression:** Creating art, music, ideas, or anything that expresses your unique inner world.\n",
      "*   **Happiness & Well-being:** Finding joy, peace, and contentment in the present moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### So, what is the meaning of life?\n",
      "\n",
      "The most powerful conclusion might be that the question itself is flawed. Instead of asking \"What is **the** meaning of life?\", a more useful question might be:\n",
      "\n",
      "**\"What gives *my* life meaning?\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is not a destination you arrive at, but a path you walk every day. It's the reason you get out of bed in the morning. It's found in the love you give, the problems you solve, the beauty you create, and the connections you forge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the meaning of life is not something to be *found*, but something to be *built*. And you are the architect.\n"

    "\n",
    "    Your mission is to find the best possible set of features to classify the reactions. To do this systematically and avoid errors, you must follow this multi-stage workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Stage 1: Baseline Analysis**\n",
    "    1.  **Load Dev Data**: Use `get_dev_data_and_y()` to get the development dataset.\n",
    "    2.  **Generate Existing Features**: Use the provided tools (like `rpka_analysis.analyze_rpka_features` and `vtna_analysis.get_vtna_fingerprint`) to generate a set of baseline features.\n",
    "    3.  **Baseline Evaluation**: Create a feature matrix from these baseline features and evaluate it using `evaluate_features_m6_m8_m11_m14` on the **evaluation set**. This will give you a baseline accuracy and show you which of the existing features are most important. This is your starting point. To do this, you must first generate features for the dev set, then generate features for the eval set, and pass the eval features to the evaluation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Stage 2: Iterative Feature Engineering**\n",
    "    This is a cycle. Repeat these steps to improve your feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **Hypothesize**: Based on the baseline results and your chemical knowledge, form a hypothesis for a new feature.\n",
    "        -   **Idea 1: Combine existing features.** Can you create a more powerful feature by combining existing ones (e.g., `feature_A / feature_B`, `feature_A * feature_C`)?\n",
    "        -   **Idea 2: Engineer new features from scratch.** Look at the raw data directly. Print out the `time_data` and `product_data` for a few samples from different classes. Can you see a shape or a pattern that your current features don't capture?\n",
    "        -   **Idea 3: Try new techniques.** The provided tools are a good start, but they don't include everything. You could try:\n",
    "            -   *Curve Fitting*: Fit a mathematical model (e.g., exponential, sigmoid) to the concentration profiles and use the fitted parameters as features.\n",
    "            -   *Data Preprocessing*: Apply smoothing (e.g., a moving average) to the raw data before calculating rates to reduce noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **Implement**: Write the Python code to calculate your new feature(s) for all samples in the development set.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  **Sanity Check**: Before running a full evaluation, you MUST check your new feature. For each class, calculate and print basic statistics (min, max, mean, std) of your new feature using the development data. \n",
    "        -   **Error Checking**: Does the `max` value look absurdly large? Is the `std` zero? This can help you catch bugs in your calculation.\n",
    "        -   **Separation Power**: Is there a visible difference in the `mean` value between the classes? This gives you a hint if the feature is likely to be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.  **Evaluate**: If the feature looks reasonable, add it to your feature matrix and test its impact. Don't feel constrained to a small number of features. Given the size of the dataset (~5000 samples per class), exploring feature sets with 20, 30, or even more potentially useful features is a good strategy. The robust nature of Random Forest and our separate evaluation set will protect against overfitting. After adding your new feature(s), regenerate the full feature matrix for the evaluation set and pass it to `evaluate_features_m6_m8_m11_m14`. Did the accuracy improve?\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Stage 3: Final Report**\n",
    "    Once you have reached the target accuracy of 0.85 or are satisfied with your feature set, generate a final report detailing your best features, the logic behind them, and the final accuracy achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Important Rules:**\n",
    "    -   **Data Separation**: Always perform your feature development and sanity checks on the **development set** (`get_dev_data_and_y`). Only use the **evaluation set** for final, unbiased scoring.\n",
    "    -   **Performance Constraint**: Your feature generation code must be efficient. The entire feature extraction process for all samples in a dataset (either dev or eval) should complete in **under 20 minutes**. Be mindful of this when implementing computationally expensive methods like curve fitting. If a method is too slow, consider applying it to a subset of the data or finding a faster alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The features could be numerical values, boolean values, and string labels.\n",
    "    From the previous trial, the parameters that are obtained by fitting the kinetic data could be one of the important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Think about what features would be useful to distinguish between the mechanisms. Look closely at the differences in the reaction mechanisms to inspire new features. For example, M11 and M14 involve catalyst deactivation, which might be observable in the kinetic profiles as a decrease in reaction rate over time that is not due to substrate depletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    YOU MUST NOT USE ANY PLOT TOOLS. YOU CANNOT ACCESS TO THE IMAGE FILES.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Iterate until you achieve the accuracy of 0.85 or the iteration number reaches 100.\n",
    "    Finally, you must output the report that explains your hypothesis, features, and the accuracy of the classification by random forest.\n",
    "    Please end your final response with \"<<DONE>>\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    MUST NOT generate fake evaluation result during the process.\n",
    "    Your thinking process is monitored and if you generate fake evaluation result, you will be punished.\n",
